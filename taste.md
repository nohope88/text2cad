# Product taste

Structure borrowed from leonxlnx/taste-skill (a frontend skill — only its shape
transfers, none of its content): name the defaults a model falls into and ban
them mechanically, give it a vocabulary of better moves, and put intensity on
dials instead of in prose.

Written for DISCOVER and BRIEF — the phases that choose WHAT to make. BUILD and
REPAIR have their own corpus in lessons.md and must not be handed this one.

## Dials

Read from .env, shown with the run's current values. They set intent, not style.

- **NOVELTY** — 1 = a safe familiar object, 10 = nothing like it exists.
- **MECHANISM** — 1 = one static part, 10 = a multi-part assembly whose moving
  relationship IS the product. This is the part-count and motion dial.
- **ORNAMENT** — 1 = pure function, 10 = heavily decorated surface. Never buy
  novelty here: a pattern wrapped around a boring solid is still a boring solid.

## Slop — the shapes every model defaults to

Each of these is an instant reject, however good the theme is. They are what
the marketplaces are already drowning in, and a model reaches for them because
they are easy to model, not because anyone wants them.

- A silhouette extruded into a slab with every edge filleted.
- Low-poly faceted animal.
- Voronoi / cellular shell wrapped around some other object.
- Honeycomb or hex-panel used as decoration.
- Infill pattern (gyroid, gears, waves) exposed as the visible surface.
- Open-top box with a friction-fit lid.
- Print-in-place articulated dragon / snake / axolotl.
- Nameplate, word-art, a word rendered as the object.
- "<theme>-shaped holder for <thing>": a silhouette with a hole in it.
- Perfect bilateral symmetry with nothing to look at off-axis.
- Chamfered cube with a logo debossed on one face.
- Spiral-vase stacked-ring vessel.
- Compartment tray / drawer organizer.
- Cute blob with googly eyes.

If the winning idea's one-line description would still make sense after
swapping the theme for any other theme, it is a themed skin — reject it.

## Moves — the vocabulary to reach for

Name the mechanism explicitly in the brief so BUILD models the real thing.
A high MECHANISM dial means the object should be built around one of these,
not merely contain one.

**Motion and constraint**
- Living hinge — thin flexure, prints flat, folds into a volume.
- Compliant cantilever snap; bistable snap with two stable states.
- Cam and follower — rotation becomes linear travel.
- Ratchet and pawl; escapement.
- Print-in-place planetary or herringbone gear train.
- Iris / aperture — overlapping blades on a rotating ring.
- Gimbal — nested rings, two or three axes.
- Counterweight, pendulum, tippe-top, gravity-driven return.
- Tensegrity — parts held apart by tension only, nothing touching.

**Joining and assembly**
- Captive nut or captive ball, printed around and never removable.
- Screw thread as the interaction itself: twist to open, dose, raise, reveal.
- Quarter-turn bayonet; eccentric cam lock.
- Dovetail slide; tongue-and-groove modules that tile without fasteners.
- Kinematic mount — three balls in three vees, repeatable seating.
- Nested parts that store inside each other when not in use.

**Optical and surface**
- Light pipe, lens, caustic surface, moiré pair.
- Anisotropic surface that changes with viewing angle.
- A silhouette that reads as two different objects from two angles.

A part count of 2-6 is the target. Every part must earn its place: if removing
a part costs the object nothing, it was decoration, not mechanism.
